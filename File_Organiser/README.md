File Organising program :
This program organises files based on their extensions, thereby making any folder clutter-free. You can define folders to move files with different extensions.  

-> Prerequisite
   Install the required dependancies . To do so, just type : 
        pip install -r requirements.txt

-> Run the main file:
   On Windows: 
        python main.py

   On Linux or iOS:
        python3 main.py

-> If you are running the file for the first time , then the program will ask for your preferences.For example, when it asks you for the Documents path , type where you would want your all documents(.pdf,.docx,.xlsx,.pptx) to go. The setup generates a configuration file which stores all your preferences!

-> After the inital setup is completed , then rerun the program .

-> The program then asks you the target folder ; i.e ; The folder which you want to be cleaned.

-> Then the program does its work of organising the files .

Thats it ! 
Cheers!!
